Spring was in the air. 

The animals were in high spirits because of the green vegetation everywhere and the merry environment. 

The trees had borne new saplings, fruits covered the branches, and the fragrance of the flowers was intoxicating. 

In the midst of this cheerful atmosphere, happy bees, pigeons, parrots, peacocks, deer, rabbits, and butterflies came together at a lake by the jungle for some water. 

The representatives of various groups will speak about their group’s contribution toward the environment that we all share and live in. 

This meeting will strengthen the bond between the animals and the humans and will benefit all.” 

All the animals agreed gladly to the rabbit’s idea and fixed a date for the meeting. 

They also decided to write an invitation letter to the human beings. 

A deer suggested organizing a small luncheon and a song & dance performance to make the meeting more interesting. 

The day came. 

As decided earlier, all the animals came in their best attire. 

The meeting was held at the lush green field of the Sundarijal hills. 

The program started with a folk song. 

After the song, the pigeon gave a formal speech to commence the program. 

The pheasant was made the Chairperson. 

Representatives of the human beings were introduced as special guests at the podium.

The Chairperson invited the speakers to the podium one by one. 

A butterfly said in its speech, “Our group flaps its wings to fly everywhere and gives pleasure to one and all.

The children especially love us and try to catch our wings.”
